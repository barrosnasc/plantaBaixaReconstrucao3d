  abstract       = {Research on converting 2D raster drawings into 3D vector data has a long history in the field of pattern recognition. Prior to the achievement of machine learning, existing studies were based on heuristics and rules. In recent years, there have been several studies employing deep learning, but a great effort was required to secure a large amount of data for learning. In this study, to overcome these limitations, we used 3DPlanNet Ensemble methods incorporating rule-based heuristic methods to learn with only a small amount of data (30 floor plan images). Experimentally, this method produced a wall accuracy of more than 95% and an object accuracy similar to that of a previous study using a large amount of learning data. In addition, 2D drawings without dimension information were converted into ground truth sizes with an accuracy of 97% or more, and structural data in the form of 3D models in which layers were divided for each object, such as walls, doors, windows, and rooms, were created. Using the 3DPlanNet Ensemble proposed in this study, we generated 110,000 3D vector data with a wall accuracy of 95% or more from 2D raster drawings end to end.},

  abstract  = {Floor plan recognition is of great significance in building information modeling (BIM), intelligent applications on buildings and smart cities. With the recent progresses on AI and computer vision, automatic floor plan understanding from 2D architectural plan drawings have become possible. However, prior rules-based approaches have difficulties handling complex irregular shapes while more complicated designs. Adaptive methodologies and semantic cognizance of deep learning techniques do enhance the framework but they need for broad group of labeled facts and additionally, even then they do not affect the chief segment of the communication. Floor plan recognition face challenges in generalization and architect reasoning. We conducted a systematic survey on the research from 2000-2025, review the evolution, advantages and disadvantages, as well as prospects in floor plan recognition methods.},
