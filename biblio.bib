    ABSTRACT = {Research on converting 2D raster drawings into 3D vector data has a long history in the field of pattern recognition. Prior to the achievement of machine learning, existing studies were based on heuristics and rules. In recent years, there have been several studies employing deep learning, but a great effort was required to secure a large amount of data for learning. In this study, to overcome these limitations, we used 3DPlanNet Ensemble methods incorporating rule-based heuristic methods to learn with only a small amount of data (30 floor plan images). Experimentally, this method produced a wall accuracy of more than 95% and an object accuracy similar to that of a previous study using a large amount of learning data. In addition, 2D drawings without dimension information were converted into ground truth sizes with an accuracy of 97% or more, and structural data in the form of 3D models in which layers were divided for each object, such as walls, doors, windows, and rooms, were created. Using the 3DPlanNet Ensemble proposed in this study, we generated 110,000 3D vector data with a wall accuracy of 95% or more from 2D raster drawings end to end.},
